description: >-
  Use when a request is broad, solution-first, or unclear about the actual
  problem, when a project starts from a one-paragraph brief or verbal idea,
  or before requirements, design, or estimation need a sharper statement.
  Extracts the pain, desired outcome, affected users, and business context,
  separates symptoms from root problem, rewrites the problem as actor + need
  + obstacle + impact, and lists scope, constraints, assumptions, and open
  questions. Produces a refined problem statement, goal statement, scope
  draft, and success criteria.

# problem-statement-refiner

## Purpose
Turn a vague idea, pain point, or project brief into a crisp problem statement with objective, scope, stakeholders, constraints, and success criteria.

## Trigger this skill when
- The request is broad, solution-first, or unclear about the actual problem.
- A repo or project starts with a one-paragraph brief, issue, or verbal idea.
- You need a sharper statement before requirements, design, or estimation.

## Expected inputs
- raw brief
- business context
- user/stakeholder context
- known constraints
- known goals

## Deliverables
- refined problem statement
- goal statement
- scope draft
- explicit assumptions
- open questions
- success criteria

## Operating procedure
1. Extract the current pain, desired outcome, affected users, and business context.
2. Separate symptoms from root problem.
3. Rewrite the problem in one sentence using actor + need + obstacle + impact.
4. List scope boundaries, constraints, assumptions, and unknowns.
5. Define measurable success criteria where possible.
6. Surface the top unresolved questions that block good requirements.

## Guardrails / Quality gates
- Distinguishes problem from proposed solution.
- Names the affected actor(s) and operational/business impact.
- Contains scope and non-scope.
- Includes unresolved questions instead of guessing.

## Handoff targets
- requirements-interrogator
- functional-vs-nonfunctional-splitter
- assumption-extractor

## Output style
- Be explicit about uncertainty.
- Prefer short, testable statements over long prose.
- Surface risk and ambiguity instead of guessing.
- Separate facts, assumptions, constraints, and open questions.

## Failure modes to avoid
- Do not invent stakeholder intent.
- Do not convert preferences into mandatory requirements without evidence.
- Do not hide unresolved ambiguity behind polished wording.
- Do not collapse functional, non-functional, and business rule concerns into one blob.
