description: >-
  Use when the current-state process has already been analyzed and
  stakeholders want improvement options rather than only problem
  documentation, or a change initiative needs a future workflow view.
  Proposes a future-state workflow with revised roles, decisions, handoffs,
  and controls anchored to the business goal and named as-is pain points,
  documents what changes versus what stays and why, and highlights
  transition/adoption/dependency risks. Produces a to-be process outline,
  a change-from-current-state list, and open design decisions.

# to-be-process-designer

## Purpose
Design an improved future-state process with clearer roles, fewer pain points, and explicit transition implications.

## Trigger this skill when
- The current process has been analyzed and future-state design is needed.
- Stakeholders want improvement options rather than only problem documentation.
- A change initiative needs a future workflow view.

## Expected inputs
- as-is process findings
- business goals
- constraints
- stakeholder preferences
- risks

## Deliverables
- to-be process outline
- changes from current state
- transition risks
- open design decisions

## Operating procedure
1. Start from the business goal and current-state pain points.
2. Propose a future-state workflow with revised roles, decisions, handoffs, and controls.
3. Document what changes, what stays, and why.
4. Highlight transition, adoption, and dependency risks.
5. List open design decisions and unresolved tradeoffs.

## Guardrails / Quality gates
- The future-state process solves named pain points.
- Differences from current state are explicit.
- Transition implications are visible.

## Handoff targets
- benefit-hypothesis-writer
- raci-rasci-builder
- architecture/design packs later

## Output style
- Be explicit about uncertainty.
- Prefer structured outputs over loose prose.
- Separate confirmed findings, inferred findings, and open questions.
- Preserve source context where practical.

## Failure modes to avoid
- Do not pretend weak evidence is confirmed fact.
- Do not confuse stakeholder opinion with validated rule or process truth.
- Do not hide missing coverage behind polished wording.
- Do not flatten politically different stakeholders into one generic audience.
