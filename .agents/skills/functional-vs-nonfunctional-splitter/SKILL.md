  Use when requirements are mixed together in prose, a brief uses vague
  quality words like reliable/scalable/simple/secure/fast, or design,
  estimation, or test planning needs cleaner input. Classifies each
  requirement statement as functional, non-functional, business rule,
  external constraint, assumption, or design choice, splits blended
  statements into atomic requirements, and groups non-functional items by
  category (performance, security, usability, reliability, maintainability,
  compliance, supportability). Produces a functional list, a non-functional
  list, and a misclassified-statements list.

# functional-vs-nonfunctional-splitter

## Purpose
Separate behaviors the system must perform from quality attributes, constraints, and operational rules.

## Trigger this skill when
- Requirements are mixed together in prose.
- A brief uses vague statements like reliable, scalable, simple, secure, fast.
- You need a cleaner input for design, estimation, or test planning.

## Expected inputs
- requirements text
- scope notes
- stakeholder needs

## Deliverables
- functional requirements list
- non-functional requirements list
- misclassified statements list

## Operating procedure
1. Extract each requirement statement independently.
2. Classify it as functional, non-functional, business rule, external constraint, assumption, or design choice.
3. Rewrite blended statements into multiple atomic requirements where necessary.
4. Group non-functional items by category such as performance, security, usability, reliability, maintainability, compliance, and supportability.

## Guardrails / Quality gates
- Each requirement is atomic.
- Quality constraints are not mislabeled as features.
- Design choices are not silently treated as requirements.

## Handoff targets
- acceptance-criteria-writer
- requirements-prioritizer
- requirements-traceability-starter

## Output style
- Be explicit about uncertainty.
- Prefer short, testable statements over long prose.
- Surface risk and ambiguity instead of guessing.
- Separate facts, assumptions, constraints, and open questions.

## Failure modes to avoid
- Do not invent stakeholder intent.
- Do not convert preferences into mandatory requirements without evidence.
- Do not hide unresolved ambiguity behind polished wording.
- Do not collapse functional, non-functional, and business rule concerns into one blob.
