description: >-
  Use when a RACI is too coarse because some activities need a distinct
  "Support" role alongside Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, and Informed —
  common in delivery activities where one person owns execution but others
  provide hands-on support without accountability. Builds a RASCI matrix,
  detects cells with too many Accountables, missing Responsible owners, or
  excessive Consulted overhead, and flags role conflicts needing escalation.
  Produces a RASCI matrix with ownership-gap and bottleneck notes.

# raci-rasci-builder

## Purpose
Clarify ownership, support, consultation, and accountability across analysis and delivery activities.

## Trigger this skill when
- Roles are blurred or multiple people assume someone else owns the work.
- Approvals and responsibilities are slowing progress.
- You need a clear participation model for analysis and design tasks.

## Expected inputs
- stakeholder list
- work activities
- decision points
- org context

## Deliverables
- RACI or RASCI matrix
- role ambiguities
- ownership gaps
- decision bottlenecks

## Operating procedure
1. List key activities, decisions, and artifact responsibilities.
2. Assign Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed, and optionally Support roles.
3. Detect cells with too many accountables, no responsible owner, or excessive consultation overhead.
4. Highlight role conflicts and escalation needs.
5. Output the matrix with interpretation notes.

## Guardrails / Quality gates
- Every critical activity has a responsible owner.
- Accountability is singular where appropriate.
- The matrix exposes bottlenecks instead of hiding them.

## Handoff targets
- stakeholder-communication-planner
- workshop-design
- project-planning packs later

## Output style
- Be explicit about uncertainty.
- Prefer structured outputs over loose prose.
- Separate confirmed findings, inferred findings, and open questions.
- Preserve source context where practical.

## Failure modes to avoid
- Do not pretend weak evidence is confirmed fact.
- Do not confuse stakeholder opinion with validated rule or process truth.
- Do not hide missing coverage behind polished wording.
- Do not flatten politically different stakeholders into one generic audience.

## Minimum output skeleton
See also: docs/ba/templates/raci-matrix-template.csv — already includes an S/Support column, so it's a compatible starting point for a RASCI matrix without modification.
