description: >-
  Use when a team needs a shared completion standard, features are closing
  without consistent evidence, or agile/iterative delivery needs a DoD.
  Extracts mandatory completion conditions from the requirement set, adds
  minimum gates for design-impact review, tests passed, docs updated,
  security/privacy checks, and deployment/rollback readiness, and splits
  universal DoD items from feature-specific additions. Produces a definition
  of done, an evidence checklist, and release readiness notes.

# definition-of-done-drafter

## Purpose
Draft a requirement-aware definition of done covering analysis, design, implementation, testing, documentation, and operational readiness.

## Trigger this skill when
- The team needs a shared completion standard.
- Features are closing without consistent evidence.
- Agile or iterative delivery is in use.

## Expected inputs
- requirements
- acceptance criteria
- constraints
- quality expectations
- team process notes

## Deliverables
- definition of done
- evidence checklist
- release readiness notes

## Operating procedure
1. Extract mandatory completion conditions from the requirement set.
2. Add minimum gates for design impact checked, tests passed, docs updated, security/privacy checks, and deployment/rollback readiness where relevant.
3. Split universal DoD items from feature-specific additions.

## Guardrails / Quality gates
- Done criteria are evidence-based.
- The DoD reflects project risk and domain, not generic fluff.
- Feature-specific obligations remain visible.

## Handoff targets
- requirements-traceability-starter
- agile/project/testing packs later

## Output style
- Be explicit about uncertainty.
- Prefer short, testable statements over long prose.
- Surface risk and ambiguity instead of guessing.
- Separate facts, assumptions, constraints, and open questions.

## Failure modes to avoid
- Do not invent stakeholder intent.
- Do not convert preferences into mandatory requirements without evidence.
- Do not hide unresolved ambiguity behind polished wording.
- Do not collapse functional, non-functional, and business rule concerns into one blob.
